# STM32 Oscilloscope App 🖥️🔬

This is an oscilloscope application built with STM32 Nucleo-H533RE boards and Python (PyQt5). The app allows users to capture, visualize, and analyze waveform data in real-time, with adjustable parameters such as time base, voltage scale, and trigger settings. The waveform data can be logged and exported to text files for further analysis.

## Features ✨

- Real-time waveform display 📊
- Adjustable settings (time/div, volts/div, trigger) ⚙️
- Data logging to text files 💾
- Multi-channel support (if using both Nucleo boards) 🔌
- Zoom functionality for waveform analysis 🔍
- Simple and intuitive GUI built with PyQt5 🖱️

## Requirements ⚡

- Python 3.x 🐍
- PyQt5 📦
- STM32 Nucleo-H533RE boards 🖧
- STM32CubeIDE for programming STM32 boards 💻
- USB cable for connecting the Nucleo boards to your PC 🔌
