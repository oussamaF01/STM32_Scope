# STM32 Oscilloscope App

This is an oscilloscope application built with STM32 Nucleo-H533RE boards and Python (PyQt5). The app allows users to capture, visualize, and analyze waveform data in real-time, with adjustable parameters such as time base, voltage scale, and trigger settings. The waveform data can be logged and exported to text files for further analysis.

## Features

- Real-time waveform display
- Adjustable settings (time/div, volts/div, trigger)
- Data logging to text files
- Zoom functionality for waveform analysis
- Simple and intuitive GUI built with PyQt5

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- PyQt5
- STM32 Nucleo-H533RE boards
- STM32CubeIDE for programming STM32 boards
- USB cable for connecting the Nucleo boards to your PC
